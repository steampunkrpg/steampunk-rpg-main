After stuff happens, you rush to the mountains by following the beam of light from the staff through the forest. When you arrive to the base of the mountains, you see the bodies of multiple soldiers half buried by the snow. You come to the conclusion that there was an avalanche. In the distance, you see a dimly lit cave. As you approach the cave, you begin to see patches of blood scattered across the walls. You enter the cave to see an old man laying on the ground, barely clinging on to life. As you approach, he pulls out a scroll and weakly holds it up to you. He says, “Take it. It’s your only hope. Go to the Shadow Ridge and use this to kill the king.” When you take the scroll, he fades from life. Rip in peace.
