You decide to ignore the forest; finding Barklius is highest priority. You follow the beam of light from the staff to the mountains. When you arrive to the base of the mountains, you see a group of soldiers camped out. In the distance, you see a cave that is lit up and you fear that the soldiers will attack soon. You ambush the soldiers.

You have defeated all of the soldiers but you see a dull dot of grey in the near distance getting bigger by the second. A voice calls out to you from the cave to come forth. You rush to the cave and see and old man preparing a spell at the entrance. You rush inside and the man casts a spell. The mountain beings to tremble. Suddenly, snow rushes down the side of the mountain. It seems that the man has caused an avalanche. The soldiers at the base of the mountain are immediately wiped out.
