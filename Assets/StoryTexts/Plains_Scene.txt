You arrive to Barklius’ house to discover that it was destroyed during the battle. In a panic, you search the rubble looking for Barklius’ body. You see signs of a bloody battle. The magician did not go down without a fight. However, it seems that his body is nowhere to be found, but you find a chest with the lock blown off. You open the chest and find a bundle of scrolls and a note at the bottom. The note says: “If you are reading this, I have left to finish my spell to defeat the king. Do not pursue, for I am likely being followed.” The hero pockets the scroll but finds the king’s men arriving as he begins to leave. He must fight them to keep the secret safe.

Sand in house. No sand in area. Maybe check out the desert?
