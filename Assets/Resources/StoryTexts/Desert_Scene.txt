You search the desert for days, only to find a magic staff half buried in the sand. You pick up the staff out of curiosity. At the tip of the staff rests a precious blue gem. Upon rubbing the gem, it lights up and a beam of light shoots out from within. The light is pointing in the direction of the mountains. You are ambushed by king’s men who must have seen beam of light and sent troops from nearby garrison.

A sandstorm begins to pick up and, the enemy troops retreat and manage to escape. You search the bodies of the slain soldiers in hopes of finding any clues regarding future instructions. You find a letter on of the soldiers with the instruction to burn down the forest. You realize that the burning of the forest marked the beginning of the king’s reign of terror. It might be best to go save the forest, but you have an inkling that Barklius is in the mountains and is in great danger.
