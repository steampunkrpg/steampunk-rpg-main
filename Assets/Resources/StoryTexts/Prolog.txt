The scientists have sent you back 300 years to the Whispering Plains, where it is rumored that a magician named Barklius was murdered during the first uprising. Rumors spread that Barklius knew the secret to the King’s immortality/strength (or what made him unstoppable) and how to end it. Find Barklius and make sure he is not killed.
