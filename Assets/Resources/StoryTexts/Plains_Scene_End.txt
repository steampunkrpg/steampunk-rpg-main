You have defeated the king's men. Unsure of where to go next, you check the house again. When you enter the house, you notice that there is an open scroll on the table covered in sand. Upon reviewing the scroll, you realize that this is a portal spell. Trying to make a connection, you conclude that Barklius has gone to the desert.
